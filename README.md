# MAT_4509( Probability and statistics)
In this repository I will upload the assignment codes in R programming.
it will also have the projects or excercises i will do on my 5th semester.
## Course Rationale:
Engineering students need a solid grasp of probability and statistics to assess the viability of engineering equipment effectively. This course is designed specifically to equip engineering students with these crucial skills.

## Course Objectives:
1. To teach essential statistical methods that are beneficial for engineering students.
2. To share knowledge on how to present, summarize, and analyze numerical data effectively.
3. To explain the fundamental concepts of probability and various probability distributions.
4. To elucidate the process of hypothesis testing for both large and small samples.
5. To discuss the application of statistical techniques and probability in statistical inference.

## Course Outcomes (CO):
1. Recognize statistical techniques for summarizing and analyzing data.
2. Calculate statistical measures such as mean and median from datasets.
3. Apply statistical measures and parameters to inform social and business decisions.
4. Analyze engineering problems within a statistical context.
